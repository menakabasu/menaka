(that is either a list, a tuple, a dictionary, a set, or a string).\n","\n","This is less like the `for` keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.\n","\n","With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.\n","\n","The `for` loop does not require an indexing variable to set beforehand.\n","\n","**Example**\n","Print each fruit in a fruit list:\n","\n","```\n","fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n","for x in fruits:\n","  print(x)\n","```\n","* * *\n","**Explanation**\n","\n","```\n","\n","fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n","\n","# Create a list called fruits and assign it three values: \"apple\", \"banana\", and \"cherry\"\n","# A list is a type of data that can store multiple items in a specific order, separated by commas and enclosed in square brackets\n","\n","for x in fruits:\n","\n","# Start a loop that will iterate over each item in the fruits list\n","# The word `for` means that we are going to loop for each element in the collection\n","# The variable `x` is used to store the current element in each iteration\n","# The word `in` means that we are looping over the elements in the fruits list\n","# The : sign means that we are ending the loop header and starting the block of statements that we want to loop\n","# A block of statements is a group of instructions that are indented under the same level, using spaces or tabs\n","# The indentation tells the computer which statements belong to the loop and which ones do not\n","\n","  print(x)\n","\n","  # Print the value of x on the screen\n","  # The word print is a function, which is a special kind of instruction that can do something for us\n","  # A function has a name, followed by parentheses, and sometimes has some arguments inside the parentheses\n","  # An argument is a piece of data that we give to the function to use\n","  # In this case, the argument is x, which means that we are giving the value of x to the print function to show us\n","  \n","\n","# End the loop and the program\n","# When the loop has gone through all the elements in the fruits list, it stops and the program moves on to the next statement\n","# In this case, there is no next statement, so the program ends\n","\n","```\n","\n","\n","***\n","Try it yourself below in the code
