Creating Series\n","\n","There are several ways to create a Pandas series. Here are some of the most common methods:\n","\n","1. **Creating an empty series**: You can create an empty series using the `pd.Series()` function. For example, `s = pd.Series()` creates an empty series.\n","\n","2. **Creating a series from a list**: You can create a series from a list using the `pd.Series()` function. For example, `s = pd.Series([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` creates a series with values `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.\n","\n","3. **Creating a series from a dictionary**: You can create a series from a dictionary using the `pd.Series()` function. For example, `s = pd.Series({'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3})` creates a series with values `{'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}`.\n","\n","4. **Creating a series from an array**: You can create a series from an array using the `pd.Series()` function. For example, `s = pd.Series(np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))` creates a series with values `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.\n","\n","5. **Creating a series from a scalar value**: You can create a series from a scalar value using the `pd.Series()` function. For example, `s = pd.Series(0, index=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4])` creates a series with values `[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n","\n","6. **Creating a series from an existing DataFrame**: You can create a series from an existing DataFrame using the `pd.Series()` function. For example, `s = pd.Series(df['column_name'])` creates a series from the column `column_name` in the DataFrame `df`.\n","\n","\n","\n","**Sources:**\n","\n","(1) pandas.Series — pandas 2.2.0 documentation. https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.Series.html.\n","\n","(2) Create a Series in python – pandas - DataScience Made Simple. https://www.datasciencemadesimple.com/create-series-in-python-pandas/.\n","\n","(3) Pandas Series Tutorial with Examples - Spark By {Examples}. https://sparkbyexamples.com/pandas/pandas-series-tutorial-with-examples/.\n","\n","(4) 2 Easy Ways To Create Pandas Series – The Ultimate Guide. https://data-flair.training/blogs/pandas-series/.\n","\n","(5) Creating a Pandas Series - GeeksforGeeks. https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/creating-a-pandas-series/."],"metadata":{"id":"apuJD9g4lUmE"}}]}
